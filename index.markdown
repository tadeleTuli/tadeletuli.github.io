I am a researcher in the fields of humans and robots interaction in smart and virtual environment. I am interested in solving real-time problems and challenges. Specifically, related to human motion modeling, humans and robots collaboration and interaction and object detection for industrial applications. I have project experience in Python, Matlab, and C#. I used Opencv, Unity3D, ROS and Process simulate applications during my projects.

Academically, I have successfully completed B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering, M.Sc. in Manufacturing Engineering and M.Sc. in Mechtronics Engineering from different univerities in Ethiopia and Italy. Currently, I am fully engaged on doctorial research toward my Ph.D. in the University of Siegen, Germany. 

At the University of Siegen, I am engaged in teaching undergraduate and graduate courses such as Industrial robotics (B.Sc. Mechanical Engineering), Automation and Industrial Communication Part II (M.Sc. Mechatronics Engineering), and Automation and Production Process (B.Sc. Mechanical), and various thesis projects.

In the future, not limited to but I am interested more to focus on the development of human motion behavior for machines and robots collaboration using artificial intelligence techniques, as well as in virtual reality environments.
